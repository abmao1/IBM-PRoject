## INTRODUCTION

Streaming services have transformed the way people watch their favorite shows, movies, and sports by moving to a Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) model. **Bundling** subscriptions has gained prominence due to **convenience** and **perceived value**, yet **pricing** these bundles is challenging because consumer **willingness to pay** varies significantly across demographics and preferences.

This project explores methodologies for **optimal bundle pricing**, aiming to:

-   Enhance understanding of consumer behavior

-   Inform effective pricing decisions

-   Refine methods for assessing willingness to pay (WTP)\

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Frequent and sometimes high price increases at established services (e.g., Netflix) have sparked user backlash, while competitor platforms (Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video) expand content libraries or bundle multiple offerings under a single rate. Meanwhile, ad-supported tiers introduce additional complexity when setting optimal prices.

**Key Managerial Problem**

> Streaming services must balance **competitive pricing** and **profitability** while meeting diverse consumer expectations regarding content, ads, and budget constraints.

# ANALYTICS OBJECTIVES

We specifically seek to:

1.  **Compare** Van Westendorp’s Price Sensitivity Meter, the Gabor-Granger Method, and Conjoint Analysis to assess willingness to pay (WTP) for streaming bundles.

2.  **Identify** consumer price thresholds, feature trade-offs, and optimal pricing strategies.

3.  **Develop** a **unified pricing framework** that synthesizes multiple methods for robust decision-making.

# KEY METHODS

1.  1\. Van Westendorp’s Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM)

    -   Analyzes acceptable price ranges and psychological price points.

    -   Identifies the **optimal pricing window** that balances perceived affordability and quality.

    ## 2. Conjoint Analysis

    -   Evaluates **price sensitivity** in the context of multiple attributes (e.g., ad levels, content variety).

    -   Identifies **feature trade-offs** and segments customers based on their preferences.

    ## 3. Gabor-Granger Method

    -   Tests consumer purchase likelihood at **various price points** (e.g., \$7.99, \$9.99, \$12.99).

    -   Helps determine **price elasticity** and potential **revenue-maximizing** points.

    ## 4. Integrative Synthesis

    -   Compares and contrasts insights from all three methods to **spot discrepancies** in stated willingness to pay vs. actual price thresholds.

    -   Aims to **bridge gaps** between theoretical price sensitivity and real-world pricing decisions.

# EXAMPLE CHART

Below is a simple demonstration of how you might illustrate demand curves.

```         

```{r}
#| label: sample-demand
#| echo: true

# A sample plot (dummy data)
price_points <- c(7.99, 9.99, 12.99, 14.99, 17.99)
demand_pct   <- c(80, 68, 52, 35, 20)

plot(
  price_points, demand_pct,
  type = "b", 
  main = "Illustrative Demand Curve",
  xlab = "Price (USD/month)", 
  ylab = "Subscription Likelihood (%)"
)
```
