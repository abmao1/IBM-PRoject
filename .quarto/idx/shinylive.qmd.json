In this essay, I will explain how Shinylive works, how it differs from traditional Shiny apps, and explore the advantages and limitations of this serverless model.\n\n## What is Shinylive?\n\nShinylive is a serverless variant of Shiny developed by Posit. It compiles R code to WebAssembly, allowing the R engine to run inside the user's web browser. This means that instead of hosting the app on a server (e.g., shinyapps.io or RStudio Connect), the entire app runs locally in the browser—similar to how JavaScript works.\n\nShinylive is ideal for educational tools, demos, and static site integrations.

It’s a perfect solution for lightweight applications where server overhead is unnecessary, and it opens the door for wider sharing of R-based tools in education, reporting, and outreach.
